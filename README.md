Our web-app, **PassionSave**, is a goal-oriented expense tracker for young adults. The basic idea behind this app is to provide a platform for young adults to visually track their expenses and savings with the ultimate goal of saving for their first home deposit.

A key feature of our app is the use of the TradeMe API to find the median house price for a selected region. We then calculate 20% of this median value to get how much a 20% deposit would be and then provide users with the option of setting this as their primary goal. Future versions of the app will include:
- providing a range of deposit values (eg. 10%, 25%, 30%, etc.)
- ability to add multiple goals
- authentication and security features

Team Passionfruit created this app during Summer of Tech's Create Camp 2021 (and we had an awesome time doing it!).
